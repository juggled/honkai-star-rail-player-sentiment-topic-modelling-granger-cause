Endgame with my old characters is impossible. I stopped caring about that - but for power creep to get bad enough to where my old characters were struggling to clear MAIN STORY CONTENT is unacceptable. I have to pull new units to keep up with clearing the main story, and not even endgame content. Scummy.",1,-0.714

Meaning that if you like a specific character, but don't necessarily like the ""team"" that the developers intended that character to be played with, you'd be better off just not picking up that character at all, because their performance will likely be drastically reduced outside of that team. I won't even speak on the horrible monetization practices.",1,0.8249

The graphics is nice, characters and VA are topnotch, gameplay is smooth and lots of events and rewards. Powercreep is barely felt since you can clear most of the content using basic units. Downsides are after you clear all the quests there's nothing much to do. Lack of content. Farming good equipment with good stats is extremely difficult.
